        Building websites requires HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To build websites and applications people want to use,
        which attract and retain users, you need to create a good user experience. Part of good user experience is
        ensuring the content is quick to load and responsive to user interaction. This is known as web performance,
        and in this module you'll focus on the fundamentals of how to create performant websites.
        <br /><br />
        The rest of our beginner's learning material tried to stick to web best practices such as performance and
        accessibility as much as possible, however, it is good to focus specifically on such topics too, and make
        sure you are familiar with them.
      </p>
      <h1>Learning pathway</h1>
      <p>
        While knowing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is needed for implementing many web performance improvement
        recommendations, knowing how to build applications is not a necessary pre-condition for understanding and
        measuring web performance. We do however recommend that before you work through this module, you at least get
        a basic idea of web development by working through our
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web">Getting started with the
          web module</a>.
        <br /><br />
        It would also be helpful to go a bit deeper into these topics, with modules such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML">

          </a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once you've worked through this module, you'll probably be excited to go deeper into web performance — you can
        find a lot of further teachings in our main MDN Web performance section, including overviews of performance
        APIs, testing and analysis tools, and performance bottleneck gotchas.

        You know web performance is important, but what constitutes web performance? This article introduces the
        components of performance, from web page loading and rendering, including how your content makes it into your
        users' browser to be viewed, to what groups of people we need to consider when thinking about performance.

          perceive performance?</a></p>
      <p class="block-indent">
        More important than how fast your website is in milliseconds, is how fast your users perceive your site to be.
        These perceptions are impacted by actual page load time, idling, responsiveness to user interaction, and the
        smoothness of scrolling and other animations. In this article, we discuss the various loading metrics,
        animation, and responsiveness metrics, along with best practices to improve user perception, if not the actual
        timings.

      <p>
        Measuring performance provides an important metric to help you assess the success of your app, site, or web
        service.
        <br /><br />
        For example, you can use performance metrics to determine how your app performs in comparison to a competitor,
        or you can compare your app's performance across releases. The metrics you choose to measure should be relevant
        to your users, site, and business goals. They should be collected, measured consistently, and analyzed in a
        format that can be consumed and understood by non-technical stakeholders.
        <br /><br />
        This article introduces tools you can use to access web performance metrics, which can be used to measure and
        optimize your site's performance.

      <h1>Performance tools</h1>
      <p>
        There are several different tools available to help you measure and improve performance. These can generally be
        classified into two categories:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tools that indicate or measure performance, such as <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/">PageSpeed
            Insights</a> or the Firefox <a
            href="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/network_monitor/index.html">Network Monitor</a>
          and <a href="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/performance/index.html">Performance
            Monitor</a>. These tools show you how fast or slow your website is loading. They also indicate areas that
          can be improved to optimize your web app.</li>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API">Performance APIs</a> that you can
          use to build custom performance tools.</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>General performance reporting tools</h1>
      <p>Tools like <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/">PageSpeed Insights</a> can provide quick performance
        measurements. You can enter a URL and get a performance report in seconds. The report contains scores to
        indicate how your website is performing, both for mobile and desktop. This is a good start for getting an idea
        about what you are already doing well and what could be improved.

        At the time of writing, MDN's performance report summary looks similar to the following:</p>
      <img
        src="https://echoeoe.github.io/web-performance/images/performanceImg1.png"></img>
      <p>
        A performance report contains information about things like how long a user has to wait before anything is
        displayed on the page, how many bytes need to be downloaded to display a page, and much more. It also lets you
        know if the measured values are considered good or bad.
        <br /><br />

        webpagetest.org is another example of a tool that automatically tests your site and returns useful metrics.
        <br /><br />
        Try running your favorite website through these tools and see what the scores are.
      </p>
      <h1>Network monitor tools</h1>
      <p>Modern browsers have tools available that you can use to run against loaded pages and determine how they are
        performing; most of them work similarly. For example, the Firefox Network Monitor returns detailed information
        on all the assets downloaded from the network, along with a waterfall time graph that shows how long each one
        took to download.</p>
      <img
        src="https://echoeoe.github.io/web-performance/images/performanceImg2.png"></img>
      <p>You should also check out <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/">Chrome's Network
          Monitor documentation</a>.</p>
      <h1>Performance monitor tools</h1>
      <p>You can also use browser performance tools such as the <a
          href="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/performance/index.html">Firefox Performance
          Monitor</a> to measure the performance of a web app or site's user interface as you perform different actions.
        This indicates the features that might be slowing down your web app or site.</p>
      <img
        src="https://echoeoe.github.io/web-performance/images/performanceImg3.png"></img>
      <p>See also <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/performance/">Chrome's Performance tool
          documentation</a>.</p>
      <h1>Performance APIs</h1>
      <p>
        When writing code for the Web, there are a large number of <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">Web APIs</a> available that allow you to create your
        own performance-measuring tools.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can use the <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API/Navigation_timing">Navigation Timing
          API</a> to measure client-side web performance; including the amount of time needed to unload the previous
        page, how long domain lookups take, the total time spent executing the window's load handler, and more. You can
        use the API for metrics related to all the navigation events displayed in the diagram below.
      </p>
      <img
        src="https://echoeoe.github.io/web-performance/images/performanceImg4.png"></img>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API">Performance API</a>, which
        provides access to performance-related information for the current page, includes the <a class="wavy-red"
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_Timeline">Performance Timeline API</a>, the
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API/Navigation_timing">Navigation Timing
          API</a>, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API/User_timing">User
          Timing API</a>, and the <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API/Resource_timing">Resource Timing
          API</a>. These interfaces allow the accurate measurement of the time it takes for JavaScript tasks to
        complete.<br /><br />

        The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceEntry">PerformanceEntry</a> object is
        part of the <i>performance timeline</i>. A <i>performance entry</i> can be directly created by making a
        performance <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceMark"><i>mark</i></a> or <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceMeasure"><i>measure</i></a> (for example by
        calling the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/mark"><i>mark()</i></a>
        method) at an explicit point in an application. Performance entries are also created in indirect ways, such as
        loading a resource like an image.<br /><br />

        The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceObserver">PerformanceObserver API</a>
        can be used to observe performance measurement events and to notify you of new <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceEntry">performance entries</a> as they are
        recorded in the browser's performance timeline.<br /><br />

        While this article does not dive into using these APIs, it is useful to know they exist. You can also refer to
        the <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Navigation_and_resource_timings">Navigation and

        It is very important to consider how you are using JavaScript on your websites and think about how to mitigate
        any performance issues that it might be causing. While images and video account for over 70% of the bytes
        downloaded for the average website, byte per byte, JavaScript has a greater potential for negative performance
        impact — it can significantly impact download times, rendering performance, and CPU and battery usage. This
        article introduces tips and techniques for optimizing JavaScript to enhance the performance of your website.

      <h1>To optimize or not to optimize</h1>
      <p>
        The first question you should answer before starting to optimize your code is "what do I need to optimize?".
        Some of the tips and techniques discussed below are good practices that will benefit just about any web project,
        whereas some are only needed in certain situations. Trying to apply all these techniques everywhere is probably
        unnecessary, and may be a waste of your time. You should figure out what performance optimizations are actually
        needed in each project.<br /><br />

        To do this, you need to <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Performance/Measuring_performance">measure the
          performance</a> of your site. As the previous link shows, there are several different ways to measure
        performance, some involving sophisticated <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API">performance APIs</a>. The best way to
        get started however, is to learn how to use tools such as built-in browser <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Performance/Measuring_performance#network_monitor_tools">network</a>
        and <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Performance/Measuring_performance#performance_monitor_tools">performance</a>
        tools, to see what parts of the page load are taking a long time and need optimizing.
      </p>
      <h1>Optimizing JavaScript downloads</h1>
      <p>The most performant, least blocking JavaScript you can use is JavaScript that you don't use at all. You should
        use as little JavaScript as possible. Some tips to bear in mind:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>You don't always need a framework</strong>: You might be familiar with using a <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks">JavaScript
            framework</a>. If you are experienced and confident with using this framework, and like all of the tooling
          it provides, then it might be your go-to tool for building most projects. However, frameworks are
          JavaScript-heavy. If you are creating a fairly static experience with few JavaScript requirements, you
          probably don't need that framework. You might be able to implement what you need using a few lines of standard
          JavaScript.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consider a simpler solution</strong>: You might have a flashy, interesting solution to implement, but
          consider whether your users will appreciate it. Would they prefer something simpler?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Remove unused code</strong>: This may sound obvious, but it is surprising how many developers forget
          to clean up unused functionality that was added during the development process. You need to be careful and
          deliberate about what is added and removed. All script gets parsed, whether it is used or not; therefore, a
          quick win to speed up downloads would be to get rid of any functionality not being used. Consider also that
          often you will only use a small amount of the functionality available in a framework. Is it possible to create
          a custom build of the framework that only contains the part that you need?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consider built-in browser features</strong>: It might be that you can use a feature the browser
          already has, rather than creating your own via JavaScript. For example:
          <ul>
            <li>Use <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation#using_built-in_form_validation">built-in
                client-side form validation</a>.</li>
            <li>Use the browser's own <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video">&ltvideo&gt</a> player.</li>
            <li>Use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animations/Using_CSS_animations">CSS

          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You should also split your JavaScript into multiple files representing critical and non-critical parts. <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules">JavaScript modules</a> allow you
        to do this more efficiently than just using separate external JavaScript files.<br /><br />

        Then you can optimize these smaller files. <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Minification">Minification</a> reduces the number of
        characters in your file, thereby reducing the number of bytes or weight of your JavaScript. <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/GZip_compression">Gzipping</a> compresses the file
        further and should be used even if you don't minify your code. <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Brotli_compression">Brotli</a> is similar to Gzip, but
        generally outperforms Gzip compression.<br /><br />

        You can split and optimize your code manually, but often a module bundler like <a
          href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a> will do a better job of this.

      <h1>Handling parsing and execution</h1>
      <p>
        Before looking at the tips contained in this section, it is important to talk about where in the process of
        browser page rendering JavaScript is handled. When a web page is loaded:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The HTML is generally parsed first, in the order in which it appears on the page.</li>
        <li>Whenever CSS is encountered, it is parsed to understand the styles that need to be applied to the page.
          During this time, linked assets such as images and web fonts start to be fetched.</li>
        <li>Whenever JavaScript is encountered, the browser parses, evaluates, and runs it against the page.</li>
        <li>Slightly later on, the browser works out how each HTML element should be styled, given the CSS applied to
          it.</li>
        <li>The styled result is then painted to the screen.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="notebox">
        <strong>Note</strong>: This is a very simplified account of what happens, but it does give you an idea.
      </p>
      <p>The key step here is Step 3. By default, JavaScript parsing and execution are render-blocking. This means that
        the browser blocks the parsing of any HTML that appears after the JavaScript is encountered, until the script
        has been handled. As a result, styling and painting are blocked too. This means that you need to think carefully
        not only about what you are downloading, but also about when and how that code is being executed.<br /><br />
        The next few sections provide useful techniques for optimizing the parsing and execution of your JavaScript.</p>
      <h1>Loading critical assets as soon as possible</h1>
      <p>If a script is really important and you are concerned that it is affecting performance by not being loaded
        quickly enough, you can load it inside the <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head">&lthead&gt</a> of the document:</p>
      <code>
        &lthead&gt<br/>
        ...<br/>
        &ltscript src="main.js"&gt&lt/script&gt
        <br/>...<br/>
        &lt/head&gt
      </code>
      <p>This works OK, but is render-blocking. A better strategy is to use rel="preload" to create a preloader for
        critical JavaScript:</p>
      <code>&lthead&gt<br/>
        ...<br/>
        &lt!-- Preload a JavaScript file --&gt<br/>
        &ltlink rel="preload" href="important-js.js" as="script" /&gt<br/>
        &lt!-- Preload a JavaScript module --&gt<br/>
        &ltlink rel="modulepreload" href="important-module.js" /&gt<br/>
        ...<br/>
        &lt/head&gt
      </code>
      <p>The preload <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link">&ltlink&gt</a> fetches the
        JavaScript as soon as possible, without blocking rendering. You can then use it wherever you want in your page:
      </p>
      <code>&lt!-- Include this wherever makes sense --&gt<br/>
        &ltscript src="important-js.js"&gt&lt/script&gt</code>
      <p>or inside your script, in the case of a JavaScript module:</p>
      <code>import { function } from "important-module.js";</code>
      <p class="notebox">Note: Preloading does not guarantee that the script will be loaded by the time you include it,
        but it does mean that it will start being downloaded sooner. Render-blocking time will still be shortened, even
        if it is not completely removed.</p>
      <h1>Deferring execution of non-critical JavaScript</h1>
      <p>On the other hand, you should aim to defer parsing and execution of non-critical JavaScript to later on, when
        it is needed. Loading it all up-front blocks rendering unnecessarily.<br /><br />

        First of all, you can add the <mark>async</mark> attribute to your <mark>&ltscript&gt</mark> elements:</p>
      <code>&lthead&gt<br/>
        …<br/>
        &ltscript async src="main.js"&gt&lt/script&gt<br/>
        ...<br/>
        &lt/head&gt
      </code>
      <p>This causes the script to be fetched in parallel with the DOM parsing, so it will be ready at the same time and
        won't block rendering.</p>
      <p class="notebox">
        <strong>Note</strong>: There is another attribute, <mark>defer</mark>, which causes the script to be executed
        after the document has been parsed, but before firing the <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/DOMContentLoaded_event"><mark>DOMContentLoaded</mark></a>
        event. This has a similar effect to <mark>async</mark>.

        HTML is by default fast and accessible. It is our job, as developers, to ensure that we preserve these two
        properties when creating or editing HTML code. Complications can occur when, for example, the file size of a
        video embed is too large or when JavaScript parsing blocks the rendering of critical page elements. This article
        walks you through the key HTML performance features that can drastically improve the quality of your web page.

      <h1>To optimize or not to optimize</h1>
      <p>The first question you should answer before starting to optimize your HTML is "what do I need to optimize?".
        Some of the tips and techniques discussed below are good practices that will benefit just about any web project,
        whereas some are only needed in certain situations. Trying to apply all these techniques everywhere is probably
        unnecessary, and may be a waste of your time. You should figure out what performance optimizations are actually
        needed in each project.<br /><br />

        To do this, you need to <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Performance/Measuring_performance">measure the
          performance</a> of your site. As this link shows, there are several different ways to measure performance,
        some involving sophisticated <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API">performance APIs</a>. The best way to
        get started, however, is to learn how to use tools such as built-in browser <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Performance/Measuring_performance#network_monitor_tools">network</a>
        and <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Performance/Measuring_performance#performance_monitor_tools">performance</a>
        tools, to examine the parts of the page that are taking a long time to load and need optimizing.</p>
      <h1>Key HTML performance issues</h1>
      <p>HTML is simple in terms of performance — it is mostly text, which is small in size, and therefore, mostly quick
        to download and render. The key issues that can impact the performance of a web page include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Size of the image and video files: It is important to consider how to handle the content of replaced
          elements such as &ltimg&gt and &ltvideo&gt. Image and video files are large and can add significantly to the
          weight of the page. Therefore, it is important to minimize the amount of bytes that get downloaded on a user's
          device (for example, serve smaller images for mobile). You also need to consider improving the perceived
          performance by loading images and videos on a page only when they are needed.</li>
        <li>Delivery of embedded content: This is usually the content embedded in &ltiframe&gt elements. Loading content
          into &ltiframe&gts can impact performance significantly, so it should be considered carefully.</li>
        <li>Order of resource loading: To maximize the perceived and actual performance, the HTML should be loaded
          first, in the order in which it appears on the page. You can then use various features to influence the order
          of resource loading for better performance. For example, you can preload critical CSS and fonts early, but
          defer non-critical JavaScript until later on.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="notebox">Note: There is an argument to be made for simplifying your HTML structure and <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming)">minifying</a> your source code, so that
        rendering and downloads are faster. However, HTML file size is negligible compared to images and videos, and
        browser rendering is very fast these days. If your HTML source is so large and complex that it is creating
        rendering and download performance hits, you probably have bigger problems, and should aim to simplify it and
        split the content up.</p>
      <h1>Responsive handling of replaced elements</h1>
      <p>Responsive design has revolutionized the way that web content layout is handled across different devices. One
        key advantage that it enables is dynamic switching of layouts optimized for different screen sizes, for example
        a wide screen layout versus a narrow (mobile) screen layout. It can also handle dynamic switching of content
        based on other device attributes, such as resolution or preference for light or dark color scheme.<br /><br />

        The so-called "mobile first" technique can ensure that the default layout is for small-screen devices, so
        mobiles can just download images suitable for their screens, and don't need to take the performance hit of
        downloading larger desktop images. However, since this is controlled using media queries in your CSS, it can
        only positively affect performance of images loaded in CSS.<br /><br />

        In the sections below, we'll summarize how to implement responsive replaced elements. You can find a lot more
        detail about these implementations in the Video and audio content and Responsive images guides.</p>
      <h1>Providing different image resolutions via srcset</h1>
      <p>To provide different resolution versions of the same image depending on the device's resolution and viewport
        size, you can use the srcset and sizes attributes.<br /><br />

        This example provides different size images for different screen widths:</p>
      <code>&ltimg<br/>
        &emsp;srcset="480w.jpg 480w, 800w.jpg 800w"<br/>
        &emsp;sizes="(max-width: 600px) 480px,<br/>
              &emsp;&emsp;800px"<br/>
        &emsp;src="800w.jpg"<br/>
        &emsp;alt="Family portrait" /&gt
      </code>
      <p><mark>srcset</mark> provides the intrinsic size of the source images along with their filenames, and
        <mark>sizes</mark> provides media queries alongside image slot widths that need to be filled in each case. The
        browser then decides which images makes sense to load for each slot. As an example, if the screen width is
        <mark>600px</mark> or less, then <mark>max-width: 600px</mark> is true, and therefore, the slot to fill is said
        to be <mark>480px</mark>. In this case, the browser will likely choose to load the 480w.jpg file (480px-wide
        image). This helps with performance because browsers don't load larger images than they need.<br /><br />

        This example provides different resolution images for different screen resolutions:</p>
      <code>&ltimg<br/>
        &emsp;srcset="320w.jpg, 480w.jpg 1.5x, 640w.jpg 2x"<br/>
        &emsp;src="640w.jpg"<br/>
        &emsp;alt="Family portrait" /&gt
      </code>
      <p><mark>1.5x</mark>, <mark>2x</mark>, etc. are relative resolution indicators. If the image is styled to be
        320px-wide (for example with <mark>width: 320px</mark> in CSS), the browser will load <mark>320w.jpg</mark> if
        the device is low resolution (one device pixel per CSS pixel), or <mark>640x.jpg</mark> if the device is high
        resolution (two device pixels per CSS pixel or more).<br /><br />

        In both cases, the <mark>src</mark> attribute provides a default image to load if the browser does not support
        <mark>src</mark>/<mark>srcset</mark>.</p>

        When developing a website, you need to consider how the browser is handling the CSS on your site. To mitigate
        any performance issues that CSS might be causing, you should optimize it. For example, you should optimize the
        CSS to mitigate render-blocking and minimize the number of required reflows. This article walks you through key

        needed in each project.<br /><br />

        To do this, you need to measure the performance of your site. As the previous link shows, there are several
        different ways to measure performance, some involving sophisticated performance APIs. The best way to get
        started however, is to learn how to use tools such as built-in browser network and performance tools, to see
        what parts of the page load are taking a long time and need optimizing.</p>
      <h1>Optimizing rendering</h1>
      <p>Browsers follow a specific rendering path — paint only occurs after layout, which occurs after the render tree
        is created, which in turn requires both the DOM and the CSSOM trees.<br /><br />

        Showing users an unstyled page and then repainting it after the CSS styles have been parsed would be a bad user
        experience. For this reason, CSS is render blocking until the browser determines that the CSS is required. The
        browser can paint the page after it has downloaded the CSS and built the CSS object model (CSSOM).<br /><br />

        To optimize the CSSOM construction and improve page performance, you can do one or more of the following based
        on the current state of your CSS:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Remove unnecessary styles</strong>: This may sound obvious, but it is surprising how many developers
          forget to clean up unused CSS rules that were added to their stylesheets during development and ended up not
          being used. All styles get parsed, whether they are being used during layout and painting or not, so it can
          speed up page rendering to get rid of unused ones. As How Do You Remove Unused CSS From a Site?
          (csstricks.com, 2019) summarizes, this is a difficult problem to solve for a large codebase, and there isn't a
          magic bullet to reliably find and remove unused CSS. You need to do the hard work of keeping your CSS modular
          and being careful and deliberate about what is added and removed.</li>
        <li><strong>Split CSS into separate modules</strong>: Keeping CSS modular means that CSS not required at page
          load can be loaded later on, reducing initial CSS render-blocking and loading times. The simplest way to do
          this is by splitting up your CSS into separate files and loading only what is needed:
          <code>
            &lt!-- Loading and parsing styles.css is render-blocking --&gt<br/>
            &ltlink rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" /&gt<br/><br/>

            &lt!-- Loading and parsing print.css is not render-blocking --&gt<br/>
            &ltlink rel="stylesheet" href="print.css" media="print" /&gt<br/><br/>

            &lt!-- Loading and parsing mobile.css is not render-blocking on large screens --&gt<br/>
            &ltlink<br/>
              rel="stylesheet"<br/>
              href="mobile.css"<br/>
              media="screen and (max-width: 480px)" /&gt
          </code>
          <p>The above example provides three sets of styles — default styles that will always load, styles that will
            only be loaded when the document is being printed, and styles that will be loaded only by devices with
            narrow screens. By default, the browser assumes that each specified style sheet is render-blocking. You can
            tell the browser when a style sheet should be applied by adding a media attribute containing a media query.
            When the browser sees a style sheet that it only needs to apply in a specific scenario, it still downloads
            the stylesheet, but doesn't render-block. By separating the CSS into multiple files, the main
            render-blocking file, in this case styles.css, is much smaller, reducing the time for which rendering is
            blocked.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Minify and compress your CSS</strong>: Minifying involves removing all the whitespace in the file
          that is only there for human readability, once the code is put into production. You can reduce loading times
          considerably by minifying your CSS. Minification is generally done as part of a build process (for example,
          most JavaScript frameworks will minify code when you build a project ready for deployment). In addition to
          minification, make sure that the server that your site is hosted on uses compression such as gzip on files
          before serving them.</li>
        <li><strong>Simplify selectors</strong>: People often write selectors that are more complex than needed for
          applying the required styles. This not only increases file sizes, but also the parsing time for those
          selectors. For example:
          <code>/* Very specific selector */<br/>
            body div#main-content article.post h2.headline {<br/>
              &emsp;font-size: 24px;<br/>
            }<br/><br/>

            /* You probably only need this */<br/>
            .headline {<br/>
              &emsp;font-size: 24px;<br/>
            }
          </code>
          <p>Making your selectors less complex and specific is also good for maintenance. It is easy to understand what
            simple selectors are doing, and it is easy to override styles when needed later on if the selectors are less
            specific.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Don't apply styles to more elements than needed</strong>: A common mistake is to apply styles to all
          elements using the universal selector, or at least, to more elements than needed. This kind of styling can
          impact performance negatively, especially on larger sites.
          <code>/* Selects every element inside the &ltbody&gt */<br/>
            body * {<br/>
              &emsp;font-size: 14px;<br/>
              &emsp;display: flex;<br/>
            }
          </code>
          <p>Remember that many properties (such as font-size) inherit their values from their parents, so you don't
            need to apply them everywhere. And powerful tools such as Flexbox need to be used sparingly. Using them
            everywhere can cause all kinds of unexpected behavior.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cut down on image HTTP requests with CSS sprites</strong>: CSS sprites is a technique that places
          several small images (such as icons) that you want to use on your site into a single image file, and then uses
          different background-position values to display the chunk of image that you want to show in each different
          place. This can dramatically cut down on the number of HTTP requests needed to fetch the images.</li>
        <li><strong>Preload important assets</strong>: You can use rel="preload" to turn
          <link> elements into preloaders for critical assets. This includes CSS files, fonts, and images:
          <code>&ltlink rel="preload" href="style.css" as="style" /&gt<br/><br/>
            &ltlink<br/>
            &emsp;rel="preload"<br/>
            &emsp;href="ComicSans.woff2"<br/>
            &emsp;as="font"<br/>
            &emsp;type="font/woff2"<br/>
            &emsp;crossorigin /&gt<br/><br/>

          <p>With preload, the browser will fetch the referenced resources as soon as possible and make them available
            in the browser cache so that they will be ready for use sooner when they are referenced in subsequent code.
            It is useful to preload high-priority resources that the user will encounter early on in a page so that the
            experience is as smooth as possible. Note how you can also use media attributes to create responsive
            preloaders. See also Preload critical assets to improve loading speed on web.dev (2020)</p>
